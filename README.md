# MeteoScope
Like a telescope for weather

About the Challenge
If you’re planning an outdoor event—like a vacation, a hike on a trail, or fishing on a lake—it would be good to know the chances of adverse weather for the time and location you are considering. There are many types of Earth observation data that can provide information on weather conditions for a particular location and day of the year. Your challenge is to construct an app with a personalized interface that enables users to conduct a customized query to tell them the likelihood of “very hot,” “very cold,” “very windy,” “very wet,” or “very uncomfortable” conditions for the location and time they specify.
